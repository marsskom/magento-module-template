# Magento 2

I use this template: [Mark Shust's Docker Configuration for Magento ](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento).

As in usual Magento 2 template you should create module by instruction [here](https://devdocs.magento.com/videos/fundamentals/create-a-new-module/) as usual.

All modules are located in `app/code` directory.
